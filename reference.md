## Global Actions

The MIDI Actions send MIDI messages to the MIDI port selected as the Output port for the ClyphX control surface. Also, all values in MIDI Actions
should be entered in decimal.

The SCENE related Actions do not actually Launch Scenes, they Launch every Clip on a Scene. For this reason, they will function similar to Launching
Scenes when Start Recording on Scene Launch is turned on.

For Scene selection, you can use a number, a string with double-quotes or a regular expression.

### Details for SNAP Actions
 
X-Clips, and only X-Clips, can store and recall Snapshots of Track and Device settings. The Snap Action is a Track-based Action, but differs from other Actions as it cannot be used in an Action List. Upon playing an X-Clip with a Snap Action, the related settings will be stored in the X-Clip’s name along with your identifier.

You can use modifiers to Snapshot multiple tracks, for example: 1-4/SNAP DEVALL MIX+
 
| Action | Description | Examples 
| --- | --- | --- 
| SNAP DEV | Store the settings of the first Device on the Track | -
| SNAP DEVx | Store the settings of the Device where x is the number of the Device | SNAP DEV2, SNAP DEV8
| SNAP DEVx-y | Store the settings of the Devices in the specified range where x is the Device number to start with and y is the Device number to end with. There should be no space before or after the hyphen. To operate on all Devices, specify ALL | SNAP DEV1-4, SNAP DEV2-5, SNAP DEVALL
| SNAP MIX | Store the Volume, Pan and Sends settings of the Track | -
| SNAP MIX+ | Store the Volume, Pan, Sends, Mute, Solo and Crossfade settings of the Track |  -
| SNAP MIX- | Store the Volume, Pan, Mute, Solo and Crossfade settings of the Track |  -
| SNAP MIXS | Store the Sends settings of the Track | -
| SNAP PLAY | Store the playing status of the Track. This does not apply to Group Tracks, Return Tracks or the Master Track. | -
 
### SNAP Tracks
 
By default, SNAP actions are recalled immediately. If you want a smooth transition between mix values, you can use a Snap Track.

How to create and use SNAP Tracks?

* Create a new MIDI Track and rename it to 'CLYPHX SNAP'
* In clips below, create your snap actions. For example, add a few clips '[] 2/SNAP MIX' to capture mix parameters of the 2nd track
* After capturing the parameters, click again on a clip and now the parameters will transition to the new saved state

To control the transition speed, rename the track to 'CLYPHX SNAPE [value]', where value can be:

* a number, in hundreds of milliseconds. Increase the value for slower transitions, 10 is one second.
* S plus beats number, S4 for example, to have a transition during 4 beats.

Each clip can also have different timing values. Just edit the '[]' part, and add 'SP:'. For example [ID SP:40] or
[ID SP:S8].

You can also add a Rack named CLYPHX SNAP, aka Snap Rack, to the Snap Track. This will allow you to send X-Snaps to the Snap Rack and use the Snap Rack’s first macro to morph between the current values of Snapped parameters and the values stored in the X-Snap. 
 
## Track actions for Devices

Device actions are track-based and will apply to the device selected on the track, or on the 1st device. If you want to operate on a different Device, add a number after DEV: DEV3 RESET, will reset the 3rd device and, 2/DEV3 RND, will randomize the 3rd device on track 2.

A device name can also be specified with quotes (i.e. DEV"Auto Filter" RND).

## Track actions for Clips

The actions will apply to the playing Clip or if no Clip is playing, to the selected slot on the track. To operate on a different Clip, specify the slot
number of the Clip after the word CLIP: 5/CLIP1 LOOP *2

To operate on the selected slot or the Clip selected in Arrangement View, specify SEL
(CLIPSEL WARP). You can also specify the Clip name enclosed in quotes (1/CLIP"MyClip" LOOP).

By default, the Clip Note Actions (CLIP NOTES) will apply to all the Notes in a MIDI Clip that fall
within the Loop Start/End markers (if Loop is on) or the Start/End markers (if Loop is off). To operate
just on a particular pitch (or a range of pitches), specify the name (or number) of the pitch (or range)
after the word NOTES. 

For example: CLIP NOTESC#3 REV, CLIP NOTESF4-F#5 VELO <<, CLIP NOTES60 NUDGE >

To operate on Notes that fall on a particular time position (or a range of time positions) in the Clip,
specify the position (or range) and use @ as a prefix. Positions should be specified in absolute beat time
(where 1/4 note is equal to 1.0). So, in 4/4, beat 1 would be 0.0, beat 2 would be 1.0, etc. For example: CLIP NOTES @1.0 GATE >, CLIP NOTES @0.5-1.5 SPLIT

You can specify both a pitch (or pitch range) and a position (or position range) to operate on. For example: CLIP NOTESC3-F3 @4.0 DEL

## Control surface actions

Control Surface Actions relate to other Control Surface scripts that are selected in Live’s Control Surface section, in Preferences – MIDI/Sync.
In the actions below N is the number of the Control Surface to operate on, in the range of 1 to 6. This numbering is based on the number of Control Surface scripts that are selected. For example, if only two scripts are selected, the second script will be CS2 even if the script is selected in Control Surface slot #6.
You can alternatively specify the one-word name of the Control Surface to operate on enclosed in quotes (such as CS”APC20” RING T1), with spaces replaced by underscores.
