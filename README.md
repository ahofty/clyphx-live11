# The ClyphX Ableton Live script which works with Live 10 and 11

ClyphX 2.6.2 is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which means that anybody can modify and distribute it for free. It has less features than Clyph
X Pro, but the 2.6.2 is the last free version to work with Live 10.

Starting with version 2.7.0, the code was modified to work with Live 11. If you find any bugs, please report them using the Issue tab above.

You can still use it but do not try to get support on nativeKONTROL forums, it is not supported by them anymore.
